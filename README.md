**Program 4: Sorting**

This lab will serve two purposes. First, it will provide hands-on experience for utilizing many of
the sorting algorithms we will introduce in the class. Second, it will viscerally demonstrate the
cost of O(n2) v. O(n logn) algorithms. It will also clearly show that algorithms with the same
complexity may have different running times.

**Problem:**
You will write a program which implements the following sorts and compares the performance
for operations on vectors of integers of growing sizes 10, 100, 1000, 5000, 10000, 25000, etc....

1) BubbleSort
2) InsertionSort
3) MergeSort
4) Non-Recursive, one extra vector<int> MergeSort (Weâ€™ll call this improved version,
IterativeMergeSort from here on out in this homework)
5) QuickSort
6) ShellSort
